# config
Just a personal repository for vim configs and others. syntastic, and pathogen are the only plugins used. vim script copied from ninjin/vim-openbsd for formatting. Default.xml is for CLion style to try to conform to OpenBSD style(9). No clue who the hell else would want to use my stuff but here you go.
