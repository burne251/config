# config
Just a personal repository for vim configs and others. syntastic, and pathogen are the only plugins used. vim script copied from ninjin/vim-openbsd for formatting. Default.xml is for CLion style to try to conform to OpenBSD style(9). No clue who else would want to use my stuff but here you go.
