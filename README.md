# config 

Just a personal repository for configs. Anything I wrote is under ISC license,
otherwise everything else is under some form of FOSS license and should say in
the relevant file. The zsh and emacs tarballs include stuff from other projects
though, so anything compressed in those is liable to be GPL'ed or something.
